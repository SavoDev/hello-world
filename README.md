# hello-world

Hello, im Savo and im from Serbia.

Im a Junior Java Dev (Java, JS, CSS, Vue.js), and i started my joyfull jurney into programming. In future times i will make projects that you can use, and analise. Also give your feedback, since it is much abliged on my side.
Codding is something i came back to after I stopped in high school, and its been "fun" till now. And they way its going it will continue to be!
